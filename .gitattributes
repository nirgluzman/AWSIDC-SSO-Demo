# Git Attributes Configuration
#
# This file controls how Git handles line endings and file types across different operating systems.
# It ensures consistent behavior regardless of whether developers use Windows, macOS, or Linux.
#
# Key benefits:
# - Prevents "CRLF will be replaced by LF" warnings
# - Ensures shell scripts work correctly in WSL and Linux environments
# - Maintains consistent line endings across the entire team
# - Automatically handles text vs binary file detection

# Set default behavior to automatically normalize line endings
* text=auto

# Force LF line endings for shell scripts
*.sh text eol=lf

# Force LF for other script files that need to run on Unix-like systems
*.js text eol=lf
*.jsx text eol=lf
*.ts text eol=lf
*.tsx text eol=lf

# Force LF for JSON and YAML files
*.json text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf

# Windows-specific files should use CRLF
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf

# Binary files should be left untouched
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
*.zip binary
